I think its so funny to write recipies like an old internet gameguide in plaintext and upload to github

Oven Poached Salmon with buerre blanc
with risotto and milanaise asparagus
================================================
The real classical way of doing poached salmon is on top of the stove, but doing it in the oven is better bc ovens are more consistant and cause less disruption in the sauce.

The meal is intended for a date - should feel romantic and have lots of parts to mess up together <3

the draft was ai assisted, use your eyes, nose, and mouth when cooking
second pass was done after reading relivant portions of Escoffier, Childs, and a book about wine an old guy reccomended me
================================================
Shopping list:
================================================

Aluminum foil (people are often out of this)

2 large salmon fillets (ai tells me 180grams), SHOULD NOT BE SLIMEY OR SMELL - hunt for this

[im learning wine and GPT is my teacher]
dry crisp white wine 
	sauvignon blanc from loire no blends, 1-3 years old
	its called Sancerre and its centuries old, but has declined in poplarity due to reds from the region selling better
	its dry and fruity wich should be cute with the fish, veggies, and risotto
	muscadet is also fron loire valley but is not as good 

	(you should have half a bottle left after cooking assuming not much sipping happens)
		a second bottle might be needed if you are sipper
	I might look to buy a desert wine also from loire but I cant find anything about that in my dusty books
	(def chill the second bottle if you do get one, as the first bottle will be out for a while)
}

Court Boullion (really its fumet de poisson vin blanc){
	2 cups water
	2 cups wine
	like half cup vinegar
	1 yellow onion
	1 Celery
	parsley stems (childs says 6-8 per 2 cups, escoffier says '2oz' and "herb bunch")
	half oz peppercorns
	some salt
	fish bones, probably like 1 pound as its just for poaching and not for a sauce
}

3 shallot {
	one for the risotto, escoffier calls for an onion, but shallot will be used instead
	one for the salmon paching liquid
	last one for the butter sauce
}
bayleafs
white pepper
big thing of salt for brine ( I like seasalt but its $$$ )
Butter, unsalted
Italian (Arborio) rice
Parmesian cheese (get a nice block and grate it)
parsley
Asparagus - refer to childs on purchasing

================================================
Court Boullion
================================================
Prep:
	2 cups water
	2 cups wine
	1 cup vinegar
	1 rough chop carrot
	1 small yellow onion
	1 Celery
	2 bay leaf (ai said 1)
	like a tsp peppercorns
	salt 1tsp
	some fennel fonds just a handful
	parsley stems (if have)
	some leek (if have)
	fish bones (if have)

combine all in stock pot and simmer for 20-30 mins (because this is poaching liquid, less time is better)

<THIS IS WHERE I WOULD POUR THE FIRST GLASSES OF DRINKING WINE>
<Also where I would start cutting and prepping veggies and such>

skim the scum off the top regularly
simmer, not boil
strain with a sieve and set aside.

====== Start Salmon Brine ======
preheat oven to 275 (childs says 350, but its more about the liquid temperature and many ovens dont do well below 250)

Start to brine the salmon by combining 
1 tbsp of salt per cup of cold water
kosher salt or sea salt (NOT TABLE SALT)
probably like 4 cups water


ONLY BRINE FOR 10 MINS (more than 15 is DEADLY)

================================================
Poaching the Salmon
================================================
oven is at 275, the goal is to keep the liquid at a low simmer and to not have a high difference between it and the air
"A boiling that does not boil" -Escoffier
Im afaid of this though

When done with brine dry with paper towels (like dry dry)
Put both fillets in highwall ovenproof dish (I use enamaled cast iron w/ high walls)
add .5 cup boullion, .5 cup wine
slice up a shallot 
and bayleaf
pre simmer then add salmon

Cover tightly with foil and cook in oven for 15-20 mins 
actually just check temp frequently, targeting 125-130F (lower than the FDA!)
should just be opaque like do not overcook, 

Microwave a plate for like 45sec
Remove salmon and put on the warm plate and cover loosly w/ foil (dont trap steam)
rest for 2-3 mins
================================================
asparagus a la milanaise
================================================
if the asparagus is not fresh or woody, peel with pairing knife
blanch asparagus (boil in salty watter for a min or two until tender)
drain and pat dry,
while warm top with parmisan
put on warm plate and cover with foil (dont trap steam)

can also be popped into the oven for a minute before serving (oven at 275 from salmon)
just before serving:
	brown butter until its nut-colored, pour over aspargus 


================================================
Risotto (I've never done a risotto before!!!)
================================================
this is a french risotto, italians stir it constanty but the french just let it simmer while adding more liquid

mince a shallot
keep the stock on simmer or microwave to keep hot
in a saucepan 
heat up a tbsp of butter till slightly foaming (less heat is better)
add shallot and let sweeten and become transulcent (stir gently)
add 1 cup of rice and toast for 2-3 mins
the goal is to produce a milky color and not brown it

deglaze with spash of wine (ai says 60ml 🤓)
stir gently letting the rice absorb the wine

gradually add  3 cups of boullion, half a cup at a time
stir while adding and watch, as soon as liquid is abosrbed add more

gently simmer not boil, heat shouldnt be crazy
should take like 15 minutes to actualy add all the boullion

total cooking time should be like 18 mins
its supposed to be creamy not soupy, and should kinda hold its shape a bit
al dente is correct also

to finish: 
	remove from heat
	add 2-3tbsp of fresh finely grated parmesan
	and chopped parsley 
	fold together
	season with salt and white pepper

wants to finish last as it wants to be served fast!


================================================
Beurre blanc 
================================================
Sauce originates from along the Loire River!
and its pretty new historically speaking but very popular bc its easier than other sauces

mince a shallot
splash of wine
splash of the poaching liquid
(childs only uses 5tb of liquid total, 7 if you include 2 tb of butter before whipping in the rest)
add in a pan and reduce till like real thick (like 2 tbsp left)

while it reduces, cube up a stick of butter
remove from heat and whisk in the whole stick of butter, 1 piece at a time
occasionaly return to very low heat to keep beating

salt and white pepper
technically wants some lemon but im skipping

===========================================
Serving
===========================================
the risotto should be just finishing (hopefully)
so the parmesan, zest, and herbs are in theory just getting added

warm the plates in the microwave (warm not hot dont cook the fish)

Add a large spoon of risotto off center on the warm plate
lean the salmon against the risotto (the goal here is height)
asparagus on the other side of risotto I think, tbh not sure where it goes

spoon sauce on salmon, let run off onto plate 
its often really easy to overdo it with sauce, people can always add more later !!!
(remember its like condensed butter)

garnish the sauce with a parsley leag
wipe the plates clean of anjy dripping or splatters

serve with glasses of wine (hopefully theres some left!!!!)
follow up with the other wine if you got it


HOPE YOU ENJOY ~<3
